From your blog's settings, choose the layout that’s right for you. For example, a <strong>tiled layout </strong>is popular for helping visitors discover more posts that interest them. Or, choose a <strong>classic single column layout </strong>that lets readers scroll down and see your post topics one by one.</p>
<p>Every layout comes with the latest social features built in. Readers can easily share posts on social networks like Facebook and Twitter and view how many people have liked a post, made comments and more.</p>
<h2>Add media to your posts</h2><p>When creating your posts you can: </p><ul>
  <li>Upload images or GIFs</li>
  <li>Embed videos and music </li>
  <li>Create galleries to showcase a media collection</li>
</ul><p>Customize the look of your media by making it widescreen or small and easily align media inside your posts.  </p>
